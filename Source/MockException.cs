	/// <para>
	/// Moq does not provide a richer hierarchy of exception types, as
	/// tests typically should <em>not</em> catch or expect exceptions
	/// from mocks. These are typically the result of changes
	/// in the tested class or its collaborators' implementation, and
	/// result in fixes in the mock setup so that they disappear and
	/// allow the test to pass.
