* **[`DefaultValue`](xref:Moq.DefaultValue)**  
  Enumeration that defines the basic behavior of a mock.

* **[`It`](xref:Moq.It#methods)**  
  The members in this static class are used to match variable arguments against a variety of conditions.

* **[`Times`](xref:Moq.Times)**  
  Used mainly during verification to express how many number of times you expect an invocation to have happened.

* **[`MockRepository`](xref:Moq.MockRepository)**  
  This utility class is useful if you need to create several mocks that all share the same basic configuration.
